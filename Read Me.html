<p>MIDI patchbay lets you hook up your various pieces of MIDI software and
hardware and pass MIDI data between them, applying assorted filters on the way.
Things like key splits, MIDI channel remapping, transposition, etc. are
made very simple.</p>


<h2><a name="license">License</a></h2>

<p>This software is distributed under the terms of <a href="License.html">Pete's Public
License</a>.  It's free (as in beer) but the license sets out a few restrictions on
its distribution and modification.</p>

<p>If you use it I only ask for one thing:
<a href="mailto:pete@notahat.com">send me an e-mail</a>.  Tell me what
you use it for, anything you like and don't like, anything you'd like
to see in future versions, etc.</p>

<p>For other ways to reward me for producing this, see
<a href="http://www.notahat.com/software/">my web site</a>.</p>


<h2><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Mac OS X 10.2 or later</li>
	<li>A MIDI interface with OS X drivers</li>
	<li>Other MIDI software such as a sequencer or soft synth</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're looking for MIDI interface drivers or audio and MIDI applications
for Mac OS X, check out my <a href="http://pete.yandell.com/links/">links page</a>.


<h2><a name="usage">Using MIDI Patchbay</a></h2>

<p>Each MIDI Patchbay document window is divided into two parts: a patch list
on the left and a set of patch controls on the right.</p>

<h3>The Patch List</h3>

<p>Each patch in the list represents a connection
between a MIDI input and MIDI output.  The patch's input is shown on
the left of the arrow and the patch's output on the right.</p>

<p>Below each patch's
arrow is a description of the data passed by the patch and
any filters that are applied to the data.</p>

<p>Each patch also has a checkbox that can be used to enable or disable it.</p>

<p>New patches can be created with the "Add patch" button. MIDI Patchbay
tries to create new patches intelligently based on the currently selected
patch.</p>


<h3>The Patch Controls</h3>

<p>The patch controls configure the input, output and filters for the
currently selected patch.</p>

<p>The MIDI input and output for the patch can be selected from the
appropriate popup menus.  As well as the MIDI interfaces connected to your
system, you can use the "Edit virtual inputs/outputs..." options to create
inputs and outputs that will be visible to other MIDI software.</p>

<p>Under the various tabs are options allowing you to filter the MIDI data
for the currently selected patch.</p>


<h3>Example: Creating a Keyboard Split</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Create a new MIDI Patchbay document</li>
    <li>Select the first patch in the list on the left</li>
    <li>From the "MIDI Input" popup menu choose your MIDI interface</li>
    <li>From the "MIDI Output" popup menu, select "Edit virtual outputs..."</li>
    <li>Create a new output named "Example output" and click "OK"</li>
    <li>Select "Example output" in the "MIDI Output" popup menu</li>
    <li>
        In the "Channels" tab, check the "Remap all data to MIDI channel:"
        button and choose channel 1
    </li>
    <li>
        In the "Notes" tab, check the "Only allow notes in the range:" button
        and slide the lower slider until the note A4 is selected
    </li>
    <li>
        Click the "Add Patch" button.  Note that the new patch created is
        intelligently based on the currently selected patch and already has
        the other half of the keyboard selected as its range of filtered notes
        and has its traffic remapped to channel 2.
    </li>
    <li>
        Open your favourite synth software and select "Example Output" as
        its MIDI input
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Now any notes up to A4 will be sent your synth software's MIDI channel 1
and notes above A4 will go to channel 2.</p>


<h2><a name="problems">Known Problems</a></h2>

<h3>Creating a MIDI routing loop can crash OS X</h3>

<p>For example, creating a patch that receives from and sends to the one
IAC bus is a bad idea. As soon as MIDI data gets sent to that IAC bus the
entire computer will lock up.</p>

<p>You also have to be careful not to create indirect loops, as can
easily happen with Logic.</p>


<h3>Using MIDI Patchbay with Logic</h3>

<p>Using MIDI Patchbay with Logic can crash the computer, but the problem
is easily worked around.</p>

<p>If you open a default song in Logic it will open with a MIDI track
enabled as MIDI thru. The default MIDI instrument is set to &#8216;all&#8217;
for the OUT port.</p>

<p>If your MIDI Patchbay document contains a patch that routes from a
virtual input to a virtual output, this creates a MIDI routing loop.
Logic sends instrument settings into this loop at song-open and, hence,
a crash occurs.</p>

<p>You can work around it by first disabling the patches in MIDI Patchbay,
opening Logic and turning off MIDI Thru, and then re-enabling the patches
in MIDI Patchbay.</p>


<h3>MIDI and Classic</h3>

<p>Some people have reported problems when trying to use Classic and
a MIDI interface simultaneously.  It seems that Classic will try to grab
control of USB devices.  When using this software, you should make sure
that Classic is not running.</p>


<h3>Deleting virtual inputs and outputs</h3>

<p>Sometimes trying to delete a virtual input or output will give you
a message saying that the input or output is in use by a patch and can't
be deleted even when it isn't. Saving, closing and re-opening the
document will fix this.</p>


<h2><a name="future">Future Additions</a></h2>

<p>This is what's currently on my to do list for MIDI Patchbay in rough order
of priority:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Additional filters:
        <ul>
            <li>remapping of controller messages</li>
            <li>bank select/program change messages</li>
            <li>pitch bend data</li>
            <li>mod wheel data</li>
            <li>sysex data</li>
            <li>delay MIDI data (build your own arpeggiator!)</li>
            <li>transpose within a key (magic harmonies!)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Copy and paste of patches</li>
    <li>
        Grouping of patches and assigning of keyboard/MIDI event
        shortcuts to enable or disable groups for live use
    </li>
    <li>
        Spiffier interface which takes up less screen space and
        has neat ways of doing things like keyboard splits or
        arpeggiation
    </li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="credits">Credits</a></h2>

<p>The software was designed and written by
<a href="mailto:pete@notahat.com">Pete Yandell</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to Kevan Staples for generously donating the MIDI Patchbay icon.</p>

<p>Many, many thanks to Kurt Revis both for writing
<a href="http://www.snoize.com/MIDIMonitor/">MIDI Monitor</a>, without which testing
this thing would have been a nightmare, and for answering a million of my questions.
Without his help I would have struggled over the code for a lot longer.</p>
