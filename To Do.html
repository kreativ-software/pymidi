<h2>Improvements/Cleanups</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Rewrite to use MIDIThruConnection interfaces for much better performance</li>
    <li>
        The input/output text should be reselected for editing after you
        are told that you've tried a duplicate name.  What does the UI do if
        we block things with an NSFormatter?
    </li>
    <li>
        Deleting an input/output that is in use should not be disallowed.  The user should
        be asked about it and given the option.  That would involve searching
        the patches and removing it from all patches that use it.
    </il>
    <li>
        Rename TrafficTableCell...it's not a cell for the Traffic table!
        I should rename PatchTableCell while I'm at it.
    </li>
</ul>
